                                <li>Do we need to take approval for overload if our CGPA{'>'}= 8?<br />
                                    No, sometimes ERP does not allow due to semester limit; in that case just email admin-mtech to increase the credit limit of your batch for that semester</li>
                                <li>Is it necessary to complete the bucket courses in first year only?<br />
                                    It is advisable to complete specialization and bucket courses requirement as early as possible,</li>
                                <li>Does IP/IS have to be from the same domain as the specialization?<br />

                                    Course registration is done through ERP and there is provision of registering a course as Audit or Credit on ERP</li>
                                <li>Are we allowed to convert a course registration from audit to credit or vice versa?<br />

                                <li>What is late drop?<br />
                                    Late drop is related to dropping a course in between a semester i.e.  generally, after Mid-Sem, however a late dropped course will show in your transcript with a grade "W". This is just to facilitate a student where the student is not able to cope up with a course. A student can request for late drop within the late drop period only as per the dates announced in the academic calendar</li>
                                <li>What is Project Registration?<br />
                                    This is an additional registration process for registration of IP/IS/Thesis/CapP/SP; these are project based learning courses where you have to register with a faculty advisor. This is done under the project module tab on ERP. After you register the credits in registration tab, proceed for project registration. This is the responsibility of the student to ensure that the project is approved by the faculty</li>
                                <li>If we are working on a Thesis/CapP/SP which is continued from last semester; do we still have to do the project registration?<br />
                                    Yes, after registering the credits in multiples of 4, go to project module and extend the same topic from previous/last semester</li>
                                <li>How does the summer registration happen?<br />
                                    It is the same process like a regular semester where pre-registration, registration, project registration is done in ERP. The time table and academic calendar are also announced  similar to a regular semester</li>
                                <li>If a course has pre-requisites which as  M.Tech. students we have not completed here at IIITD, however we have required background from our previous institute; how to proceed for registration?<br />
                                    Contact your instructor and seek his/her approval to register for this</li>
                                <li>We are not able to register few courses which are visible in ERP?<br />
                                    Some courses are flagged as "Popular courses", which a student canâ€™t register from his/her login. Necessary information regarding additions if allowed in the course will be sent to the students for such courses and in that case, the student need to email admin-mtech showing the interest for registration</li>
                                <li>There is a lack of IP/Cap under most of the professors and hence we are unable to complete the internship requirement of 32 credits until summer term. Whom to approach?<br />
                                    Approach the respective HOD</li>
                                <li>Are there any credits for doing internship?<br />
                                    No</li>
                                <li>Can we register for a course or project while on an internship?<br />
                                    No, before going for internship, one has to complete graduation requirements</li>

                                <li>How is the grading done for Thesis/CapP/SP. <br />
                                    <a href="https://iiitd.ac.in/academics/resources" target="_blank">Refer the Thesis/SP evaluation guidelines</a></li>
                                <li>Do we need to tell beforehand which option (with thesis or without thesis) are we choosing? <br />
                                    It is implied as you are doing the registration in ERP</li>
                                <li>Can we only register for projects (IP/IS/Thesis/CapP/SP) and not any course in a semester? <br />
                                    Yes, but it is advisable that utmost care must be taken while you take these project in your 1st  and 2nd semester; for degree you need to complete your course work as well i.e. your bucket/core and specialization courses </li>
                                <li>Can projects (Thesis/CapP/SP) be done in groups? <br />
                                    Depends on the supervisor; only in case of Thesis the work can't be defended together, hence the project work need to be distributed properly so that two students will have two different title and defend the thesis separately</li>
                                <li>Are we allowed to opt for Thesis and Capstone in a semester? <br />
                                    No</li>
